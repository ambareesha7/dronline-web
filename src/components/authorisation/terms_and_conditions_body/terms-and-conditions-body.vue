      <h4>
        Healthcare Services are provided by independent Healthcare Professionals.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Healthcare Professionals who deliver Services through DrOnline are independent
        professionals practicing within a group of independently owned professional practices.
        DrOnline does not practice medicine or any other licensed profession, and does not
        interfere with the practice of medicine or any other licensed profession by Healthcare
        Professionals, each of whom is responsible for his or her services and compliance with
        the requirements applicable to his or her profession and license. Neither DrOnline nor
        any third parties who promote the Services or provide you with a link to the Services
        shall be liable for any professional advice you obtain from a Healthcare Professional
        via the Services.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Site Content.
      </h4>
      <p>
        None of the Site content (other than information you receive from Healthcare
        Professionals) should be considered medical advice or an endorsement, representation
        or warranty that any particular medication or treatment is safe, appropriate,
        or effective for you.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Privacy.
      </h4>
      <p>
        DrOnline is required to comply with local and federal healthcare privacy and security
        laws and maintain safeguards to protect the security of your health information.
        Additionally, the information you provide to your Healthcare Professional during
        a medical consultation or therapy session is legally confidential, except for certain
        legal exceptions as more fully described in our Privacy Policy. We devote considerable
        effort toward ensuring that your personal information is secure. Information regarding
        our use of health and other personal information is provided in our Privacy Policy.
        As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain
        communications, such as appointment reminders, service announcements and administrative
        messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your Account.
        While secure electronic messaging is always preferred to insecure email, under certain
        circumstances, insecure email communication containing personal health information may
        take place between you and DrOnline. DrOnline cannot ensure the security or confidentiality
        of messages sent by email. Information relating to your care, including clinical notes
        and medical records, are stored on secure, encrypted servers maintained by DrOnline.

        The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the <b>"DMCA"</b>) provides recourse
        for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes
        their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials
        appearing on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice
        requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. In addition, if you
        believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed
        against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and
        counter-notices must meet statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. One place to find
        more information is the U.S. Copyright Office Web site, currently located at
        <a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright"></a>. In accordance with the DMCA, DrOnline has
        designated an agent to receive notification of alleged copyright infringement in

        with Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(3)(A) and should be provided in writing
