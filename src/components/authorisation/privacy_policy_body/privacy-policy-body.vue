      <h4>
        How is patient privacy protected?

      <p>
        As the healthcare professionals providing online medical and clinical services through
        DrOnline (the <b>"Healthcare Professionals"</b>, <b>"us"</b>, <b>"we"</b>, <b>"our"</b>),
        we understand that information about you and your health is personal. Because of this,
        we strive to maintain the confidentiality of your health information. We continuously
        seek to safeguard that information through administrative, physical and technical means,
        and otherwise abide by applicable federal and state guidelines.

      <h4>
        How do we use and disclose health information?

        You may revoke your authorization at any time; however, this will not affect prior uses
        and disclosures. In some cases state law may require that we apply extra protections to
        some of your health information.
