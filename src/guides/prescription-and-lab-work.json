	"content": "<p>To help you better manage your health, our doctors are able to prescribe medication and order lab tests, when clinically necessary. This allows you to get the medication you need to feel better, or to get proper testing completed to understand what underlying health issues you may have. The process for each is similar to what you’d expect when going to see a doctor in person. Here’s how it works </p> <h3> Prescriptions </h3> <p> Medication is sometimes necessary to treat issues both short and long term, and our doctors can also refill existing prescriptions. <ol> <li> If your previous doctor recommended a prescription, we will review the specific medications and advise you accordingly. </li> <li> If you require a new prescription our doctor will review your file and current illness, then prescribe to you a new prescription. </li> <li> The order will be sent electronically to the pharmacy and we will pick up the prescription when ready and deliver it to you </li> </ol> </p> <h3> Lab Work </h3> <p> Lab tests can help identify a number of health conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular-related issues, and vitamin deficiencies. <ol> <li> If your doctor recommends lab tests, they will review the specific tests to be ordered during your visit. </li> <li> During the triage visit, we will conveniently carry out all the test requests at that moment. You will not need to go thru the hassle of going to any lab to do them yourself. The electronic results will automatically be sent to your patient file which is accessible by you in your app at anytime as well as in our system to be stored for future visits. </li> <li> When your video visit with our speciality doctor takes place, he will have all the necessary information and test results to provide you with a proper diagnosis and schedule Any procedure with you if necessary. </li> </ol> </p>"
