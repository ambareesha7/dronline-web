	"content": "<p>Video visits allow our medical doctors, psychologists, and psychiatrists to provide care – without you having to leave your home. With video, they can look, listen, examine, and engage with you to diagnose your issues and provide an effective treatment plan.</p><h3>How our medical doctors make a diagnosis</h3><p>Our medical doctors use two main skills, listening and looking to diagnose medical conditions. They also utilize our state of Art Triage units to check your vitals & run the proper diagnostic tests to allow them to come to proper medical conclusion. Before each visit, patients are asked a series of questions regarding their symptoms and medical history. If more information is needed, the doctor will ask additional questions during the visit, and run further testing in the triage unit with the assistance of a Nurse. Once the visit has begun. Based on the diagnosis, the doctor may order a prescription or schedule a future visit for you with a specialist. Many of the most common ER cases can be treated by a video visit. However, to ensure that patients receive the care they need, the doctor will dispatch a DrOnline Triage unit to the patient’s location with a nurse on board to administer necessary vital check ups and run diagnostic tests. All at the comfort and convenience of your home or work place. </p><h3>How visits with our psychologists and psychiatrists work</h3><p>You can meet with a psychologist or psychiatrists from the privacy of your home; no going to an unfamiliar office, time lost getting there, or running into someone you know. Meeting with one of our psychologists or psychiatrists is the same as meeting face-to-face, but on your terms, and at the time and place that works for you. Before your visit, we will dispatch our triage unit to your location to carry out all necessary testing and questionnaires to allow your visit to be of the highest quality.</p>"
